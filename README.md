# tok-1
This contract defines a simple token that can be transferred between Ethereum addresses. The token has a name, a symbol, and a decimal precision, and the total supply is fixed at deployment time. The balance of each address can be queried using the balanceOf function, and tokens can be transferred using the transfer function.

To use this contract, you would deploy it to the Ethereum network using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, users could transfer tokens between addresses by calling the transfer function with the recipient's address and the amount to transfer.
